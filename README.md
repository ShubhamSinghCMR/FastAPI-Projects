# FastAPI

A collection of **FastAPI** projects showcasing a variety of real-world API use cases and design patterns. This repository demonstrates how to build **modern, high-performance APIs** using FastAPI, with examples that integrate authentication, databases, background tasks, and real-time features.

The projects focus on writing **clean, scalable, and well-structured APIs**, highlighting best practices such as request validation, dependency injection, and modular application design. Each project is intended to serve as a practical reference for learning FastAPI and for building production-ready backend services.

This repository will continue to grow as new FastAPI applications and architectural patterns are added.
